## About

Spring Security Server is a site for the administration of a smart door lock based on ESP32 as part of my bachelor's thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at CTU in Prague. The site provides the possibility of registration and subsequent authentication of the administrator, after which it will be possible to synchronize this account with the smart device. Subsequently, the smart lock exchanges user data, information about the closing and opening of doors using REST API, as well as provides visualization and the possibility to manage passwords and inspect history for the administrator.

Full details of the project can be found on the University database at https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/109011
